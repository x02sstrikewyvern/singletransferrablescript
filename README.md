Votes must be stored in a file named votes.json in the same directory.
votes.json must contain a 2d list, with strings being candidates in the lowest dimension, e.g.

[["candidate1", "candidate2", "candidate3", "candidate4", "candidate5"], ["candidate1", "candidate2", "candidate3", "candidate4", "candidate5"]]

The script itself must be edited to parade the different candidates. The candidates array must contain all candidate names as a list of strings, e.g.

candidates = ["candidate1", "candidate2", "candidate3", "candidate4", "candidate5"]
